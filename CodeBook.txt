This code book describes the data, resulting variables, transformations, and work performed to clean up 
the UCI HAR dataset

Data Set Information
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 
years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its 
embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular 
velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data 
manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the 
volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then 
sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor 
acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a 
Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to 
have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From 
each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency 
domain.

     The dataset includes the following files:

    'README.txt'

    'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

    'features.txt': List of all features.

    'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

    'train/X_train.txt': Training set. 

    'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

    'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

    'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

    The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent.

    'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window 
sample. Its range      is from 1 to 30.

    'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone 
accelerometer X axis in         standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same 
description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train    .txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

    'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the 
gravity from the     total acceleration.

    'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope 
for each window        sample. The units are radians/second.

Transformation details
There are 5 baseic operations the run_analysis.R Script performs:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation from the
  561 columns of measurements in x_train.txt and x_test.txt
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with the descriptive activity names found in features.txt
- Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and 
each subject

Steps run_analysis.R takes to implement the transformations above:

1. Loads required packages from library ("reshape", "data.table",and "plyr")
2. Load the features and activity labels, transpose features for use as the 561 measurement column 
labels
3. Load both test and train data and performs the following for each:
     - Applys measurment column labels from step 2
     - Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data
     - Replaces activity IDs with descriptions while maintaining orginal order of the data
     - Combines the subject id, activity description, and extracted mean and standard deviation columns
       into one data table named "Cleandata"
4. Creates another independent dataset called "tidyTable" that summarizes "Cleandata" with with the 
average of each 
     variable for each activity and each subject by using the lapply function across each record 
     in "Cleandata"
5. Writes a copy of tidyTable to file "tidyTable.txt" in the working directory
